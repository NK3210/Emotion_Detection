# Emotion_Detection
It detects the emotion of an image using Machine learning

An environment is created for a jupyter notebook using anaconda,
Tensorflow is used to carry out various processes,
A certain amount of data containing images of different expression is used to train the data,
Model is defined using the convolution layers,
Noise removal is done through normalization and reducing dimensions,
Trained model is used to give the accuracy regarding the various results,
Plotting of accuracy and losses is done with respect to the number of epochs,
Tkinter and Tensorflow are used in Visual studio code,
Several functions are defined for tracing the file path, uploading of the image, detecting emotions and specifying the dimensions of the detect button,
Also a function regarding ' Unable to Detect ' is also added which occurs when the face of an image is not clearly visible,
Sometimes the error may occur because the accuarcy of the model is about 0.6.

Using the conda environment we process the GUI file.
We get the following results:

Here are some other images which shows the results of different facial expressions:

The following is not able to detect the image as the face is not clearly oriented:
